Scaffolder aPaaS

Application Platform as a Service represents an enhanced cloud software development platform which allows developers to write code faster and finish more projects on time by utilizing Continuous Development & Delivery DSL, CLI tool and a code generation engine. Developers can easily create their own workspace server and use simple or advanced web GUI, CLI tool or any text editor and git to create multiple projects, applications and services. We believe we are the most advanced cloud RAD platform ever existed which can automatically generate source code, build, test, integrate, release, deploy and monitor cloud apps with our unique meta-programming and meta-configuration technology. Any language, framework, any technology can be supported. It is modern and open (not vendor locked in) aPaaS running on a bare-metal Kubernetes cluster.
